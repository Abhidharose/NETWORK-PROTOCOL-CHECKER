# NETWORK-PROTOCOL-CHECKER
I developed a menu-driven Python mini project based on the OSI Model and networking protocols.
The program allows users to:

Identify the OSI layer of a given protocol

View basic explanations of common protocols such as HTTP, FTP, TCP, IP, ARP, and RARP

Interact with the program through a user-friendly menu system

This project helped me understand:

OSI model layers

Role of different networking protocols

Python concepts like functions, conditional statements, loops, and input validation

It strengthened my foundation in computer networking, which is essential for cybersecurity and networking studies.
